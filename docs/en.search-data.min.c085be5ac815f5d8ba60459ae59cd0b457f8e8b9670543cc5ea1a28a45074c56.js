Introduction to Key Biological Concepts #  This appendix provides a quick introduction to biology, focussing on basic biological macromolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and small molecules. It also provides a brief overview of information flow in biological systems, discussing aspects of DNA replication, mRNA transcription, protein translation, and post-translational modifications.\nB. Reconstruction of Biological Networks #  This appendix provides an overview of reconstruction of various types of biological networks, viz. gene regulatory networks, protein\u0026ndash;protein interaction networks, signalling networks, and metabolic networks.\nC. Databases for Systems Biology #  This appendix presents a brief overview of databases of PPIs and functional associations, metabolic network databases, gene regulatory network databases, model databases, and certain miscellaneous databases.\nD. Software Tools Compendium #  Beginning with a summary of standards and formats, this appendix details various software tools that are useful for all the modelling paradigms studied in the book, such as network biology, dynamic modelling and parameter estimation, Boolean networks, constraint-based modelling, and community modelling.\nE. MATLAB for Systems Biology #  This appendix provides a solid introduction to the basics of using MATLAB, followed by a discussion on how a variety of tools and toolboxes can be used for handling various modelling and simulation tasks in systems biology.\nAppendices are located online-only at https://www.routledge.com/9781138597327.\n"}),a.add({id:1,href:'/SysBioBook/resources/further-reading/chapter-01/',title:"Chapter 1",section:"Further Reading",content:"Chapter 1: Introduction to modelling #  Can a biologist fix a radio?—Or, what I learned while studying apoptosis\nLazebnik Y (2002) Cancer Cell\nThis insightful paper by Yuri Lazebnik discusses some very interesting points related to engineering vs. biology, and underlines the challenges associated with studying biological complexity.\n From molecular to modular cell biology\nHartwell (1999)\nA nice essay on modularity in biology, and a systems perspective, from Leland Hartwell, who went on to win the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.\n Modelling viral and immune system dynamics\nPerelson (2002)\nAn authoritative review on modelling the dynamics of viral infections e.g. HIV/HCV.\n Numb3rs 1x03 - Vector (TV episode)\nThe protagonist in this show is a mathematician, who uses SIR modelling to help the FBI track down the spread of a virus in a city.\n "}),a.add({id:2,href:'/SysBioBook/resources/lecture-videos/chapter-01/',title:"Chapter 1",section:"Lecture Videos",content:"Lecture Videos #  A Massive Open Online Course on Computational Systems Biology, which is in part, a basis for this book, is also available, through the Indian educational platforms, NPTEL (National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning) and SWAYAM.\nThe lectures (including hands-on lab sessions), totalling over 30 hours of content, are also available on YouTube.\nChapter 1: Introduction to modelling #  Introduction (21:26)\n Introduction What are models?
