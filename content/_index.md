# Companion Website

This is the companion website for the book, ["An Introduction to Computational Systems Biology"](https://www.routledge.com/An-Introduction-to-Computational-Systems-Biology-Systems-level-Modelling/Raman/p/book/9781138597327), published by [CRC Press](https://www.routledge.com/). It contains additional material and information on the book.


## Overview

This book delivers a comprehensive and insightful account of applying mathematical modelling approaches to very large biological systems and networksâ€”a fundamental aspect of _computational systems biology_. The book covers key modelling paradigms in detail, while at the same time retaining a simplicity that will appeal to those from less quantitative fields. 


#### Key Features
 - A hands-on approach to modelling
 - Covers a broad spectrum of modelling, from static networks to dynamic models and constraint-based models
 - Thoughtful exercises to test and enable understanding of concepts
 - State-of-the-art chapters on exciting new developments, like community modelling and biological circuit design
 - Emphasis on coding and software tools for systems biology


The book is highly multi-disciplinary and will appeal to biologists, engineers, computer scientists, mathematicians and others.

## Reviews


_This is a very comprehensive read that provides a solid base in computational biology. The book is structured in 4 parts and 14 chapters which cover all the way from the more basic concepts to advanced material, including the state-of-the-art methodologies in synthetic and systems biology. This is a bedside book for those researchers embarking to do investigation in computational biology and a great office companion for anyone working on systems and synthetic biology._

_This is a fantastic book.  It offers an elegant introduction to both classical and modern concepts in computational biology.  To the uninitiated, it is a terrific first read, bringing alive the glory of the past and the promise of the future.  To the interested, it handholds and offers a springboard to dive deep.  To the practitioner, it serves as a valuable resource bringing together in a panoramic view many diverse streams that adorn the landscape._
