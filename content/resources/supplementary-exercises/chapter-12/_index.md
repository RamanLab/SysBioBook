    a.   Existence of core central metabolism  
    b.  Presence of conserved pathways for catabolism and anabolism  
    c.  Presence of diverse linear pathways for catabolism and anabolism  
    d.  Existence of diverse central metabolism
    
    **Ans: a, c**
    
    
2. Which of the following strategy can be employed to build a non-retroactive system?

    a.  Build a system in such a way that the system is accounted for retro-activity  
    b.  Remove a module from the system if the system alters when that specific module is changed  
    c.  Inclusion of additional circuit into the system to minimize the interference
    
    **Ans: a, c**
    

3. Which of the following can be used as genetic devices to build synthetic biological circuits?

    a. Toggle switches  
    b. Repressilator

    d. All of the above
    
    **Ans: d**
    

4. What is the number of topologies possible for a 4-node network, given that every pair of nodes have three different types of interactions, activation, repression and no effect?
