# Codes

The companion code repository to this book includes some key snippets of code that will enable readers to understand some of the models/methodologies described in this book. 

https://github.com/RamanLab/SysBioBook-Codes

The idea is to expand this repository over a period of time. If you think there is a piece of code that will help you better understand a concept in the book, please contribute an issue at https://github.com/RamanLab/SysBioBook-Codes/issues and I will be more than happy to include one or more code snippets to address it.
