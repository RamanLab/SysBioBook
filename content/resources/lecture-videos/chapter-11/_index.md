# Lecture Videos

A Massive Open Online Course on Computational Systems Biology, which is in part, a basis for this book, is also available, through the Indian educational platforms, [NPTEL (National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning)](https://nptel.ac.in/) and [SWAYAM](https://swayam.gov.in/). 

The lectures (including hands-on lab sessions), totalling over 30 hours of content, are also available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHkR7OTZy5OPhDKvFJ_Xc-PuQFw4-oCZ4).
