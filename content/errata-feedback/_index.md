# Feedback

Despite my best efforts and those of my colleagues and students who have carefully gone through the book, it is likely that there may be a few typographical/grammatical errors. Do send your feedback [via GitHub](https://github.com/RamanLab/SysBioBook/issues)---critical feedback will be much appreciated and duly acknowledged!


# Errata

* p. 278, Chapter 12: `Elowitz and Liebler` should read `Elowitz and Leibler [ref.]`. The reference is Elowitz, M., Leibler, S. A synthetic oscillatory network of transcriptional regulators. [_Nature_ **403**:335â€“338 (2000)](https://doi.org/10.1038/35002125)
